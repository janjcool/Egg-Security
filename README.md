# Egg Security
A stem project for school using an esp8266 with micropython.

## Flashing
Under the esptools directory is the micropython firmware (the .bin file) and the esptool file for flashing the firmware on the esp8266 (only tested on Linux).

## The project
We (our group) need to protect an egg by using a laser and sensor my part of the project is programming.

## Note
This website has been build upon the Linux file system so this will not work on Linux. I may add something in the future to fix this. If you would want to fix this your self you would need to change all the directory's from a foreword slash (/) to a backwards slash or two I dunno (\ or \\).
